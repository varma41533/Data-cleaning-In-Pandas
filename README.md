Customer Call List Data Cleaning and Standardization Using Pandas

Project Description:
This project involves the cleaning and preprocessing of a customer call list dataset using the Pandas library in Python. The key tasks include removing duplicate records, standardizing column formats, cleaning phone numbers using regular expressions, splitting addresses into separate components, and handling missing data. Specific transformations, such as replacing "Yes/No" responses with "Y/N" for standardization, were applied to fields like 'Paying Customer' and 'Do_Not_Contact'. Additionally, rows flagged as "Do_Not_Contact" or missing phone numbers were removed to ensure data quality. The cleaned dataset was saved as a new Excel file for further analysis or use.
